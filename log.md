# 100 Days Of Code - Chris' Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- 100 Days Of Code Kick-Off.
- Created my first react components
- Used React props for the first time
- Asked instructor a question :-)

**Thoughts:** 
I've commited to 100 days of code. 1 hour coding, every day for the next 100 days. Let's see how this will turn out. For now, I'll keep working on my frontend skills, going through a udemy meteor-and-react-course.

### Day 2: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- extracted Player and PlayerList into individual react component
- extracted the app itself to a react component
- implemented conditional rendering

**Thoughts and Takeaways:** 
- Learned about binding and how to control binding in callbacks with .bind(this)
- Learned about how to pass key-attributes to react child components: don't add them inside the class of the component, but where you render them.
- Huh! Make sure to always import named and unnamed exports correctly if you add or miss those {} on the import statement you'll probably get some really ugly-to-debug errors.

### Day 3: July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- scss / sass package (fourseven:scss) added to project (-> meteor add fourseven:scss)
- scss styling implemented

**Thoughts and Takeaways:** 
- brainstormed a bit about 100DayOfCode-Log-App
- css reset re-memorized. heard about this and probably used it a looong time ago! memory refreshed: reset your css, at least with a four-line-reset.
- learned about rem (relative em) in css styling -> set font-size to 62.5% (=10px) for html-element, then use rem to scale fonts and other sizes relative to that.
