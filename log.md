# 100 Days Of Code - Chris' Log

### Day 0: June 30, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 
- 100 Days Of Code Kick-Off.
- Created my first react components
- Used React props for the first time
- Asked instructor a question :-)

**Thoughts:** 
I've commited to 100 days of code. 1 hour coding, every day for the next 100 days. Let's see how this will turn out. For now, I'll keep working on my frontend skills, going through a udemy meteor-and-react-course.
