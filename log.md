# 100 Days Of Code - Chris' Log

### Day 0: June 30, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 100 Days Of Code Kick-Off.

**Thoughts:** I've commited to 100 days of code. 1 hour coding, every day for the next 100 days. Let's see how this will turn out. I'll keep working on my frontend skills, going through a udemy meteor-and-react-course.
